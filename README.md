## Deployment
The FitClub Gym Website is deployed on Netlify, which is known for its simple setup, excellent performance, and ease of integration with various front-end frameworks like React.js. Deploying on Netlify provides the website with fast loading times and reliable uptime. The process involves linking the GitHub repository to Netlify, which then automatically builds and deploys the site. This setup enables continuous deployment, where updates pushed to the repository are automatically reflected on the live site.

## References
This FitClub Gym Website project was primarily developed by following a detailed tutorial on YouTube. The initial codebase was cloned from the [FitClub-Starter repository](https://github.com/ZainRk/FitClub-Starter) by ZainRk on GitHub. While the core structure of the website was guided by the tutorial, I have added my own unique touches to customize the site's features and design.
